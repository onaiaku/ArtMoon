# Wayland support is ENABLED for the AppImage (unlike upstream Moonlight).
# Upstream disables it to avoid bundling an older libwayland-client.so that
# breaks host EGL symbol resolution. We keep Wayland but force linuxdeploy to
# EXCLUDE libwayland-client/cursor/egl from the bundle, so the Qt Wayland
# platform plugin links against the host libwayland at runtime - the same
# libraries KWin/GNOME already provide. Native Wayland, no XWayland fallback,
# no NVIDIA black window.
# libvulkan.so.1 MUST NOT be bundled: linuxdeploy picks up the loader from the
# CI base image, which predates Vulkan Video (VK_KHR_video_decode_*). Inside the
# AppImage it shadows the host's modern loader, so libplacebo can never see the
# GPU's Vulkan Video/AV1 decode support and falls back to VAAPI/VDPAU (or dies).
# The host loader is always the right one - same policy as libwayland above.
#
# The glib family (libglib/libgobject/libgio/libgmodule/libgthread) MUST NOT be
# bundled either: libva's driver plugins (notably nvidia_drv_video.so) link
# glib, and a bundled copy shadows the host's - on 1.1.1 the bundled gobject
# predated the host's and was missing g_string_copy, so the NVIDIA VA-API driver
# failed to dlopen and SDL reported "no functioning hardware accelerated video
# decoder" on every NVIDIA host. Glib is universal on desktop distros; the host
# copy is always the right one.
