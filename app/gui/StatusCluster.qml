/*
 * Time, date and — on a device that has one — the battery, for the top-right of the window.
 *
 * ⚠️ Instantiated once, by AppShell, and never by a page. Every page it appears on had its own
 * copy anchored to its own header, and the three headers do not agree on where their corner is,
 * so the clock moved on every page change. The positioning note is on the AppShell instance.
 *
 * One strong thing and a quiet line under it: the clock is what you look at, the date and the
 * charge are the surround and they sit together because they are the same category of thing.
 *
 * ⚠️ The battery belongs on the second line, and that is the whole layout. Given a line of its
 * own beside the clock it had nothing to align to — its centre fell between the two rows of
 * type, sharing a baseline with neither — and it competed with the one figure that should win.
 * It also settles the case the alternatives handled worst: on a desktop there is no battery at
 * all, and here that costs one chip off the end of a line while nothing else moves.
 *
 * Sizes are fixed pixels rather than the `_u` scale the cards use: this has to sit against the
 * wordmark opposite, not against the stage below it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Deliberately not shared with UnlockPad, which also draws a time and a date. That one is
 * imitating the Windows logon screen — big, light, centred — because looking like Windows is
 * how it says whose password you are typing. Same two values, opposite jobs.
