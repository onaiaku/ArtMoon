// The app's busy spinner, drawn here instead of using Material's BusyIndicator.
//
// ⚠️ Why we do not use the stock control: its arc is built as triangle geometry with
// flat ends and no track, so the silhouette is never a circle and the two ends read as
// square corners hanging off the ring. It is not a sizing artefact - it was compared
// side by side at seven sizes including the control's own implicit one, and every one
// of them showed it. Do not "fix" this by going back to BusyIndicator with a different
// height; that is the road this came from.
//
// Two properties of this one are deliberate and load-bearing:
//   - the dim track is a full 360° arc, so the outline is a true circle at every
//     instant regardless of where the moving arc happens to be;
//   - both caps are round, so neither end can produce a corner.
//
// It also ends the sizing fragility that produced a speck at small sizes (§41): the
// stroke is a fraction of the box, so it stays proportionate from 24px to 120px.
