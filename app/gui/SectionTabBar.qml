/*
 * ── The tab strip of Settings, as a component (6.0.0) ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One strip for the three places that split settings into sections: the Settings screen,
 * the host profile dialog and the per-game dialog. Written once so the three are identical
 * by construction — the same labels, the same accent underline, the same LB/RB ring —
 * rather than by three copies kept in step by hand, which is how a UI starts to disagree
 * with itself.
 *
 * `tabs` is a list of { label } or { icon }. `counts` is a parallel list of integers: a number
 * above zero draws a small accent badge after that label. The dialogs use it for "this section
 * holds this many values of its own", because splitting the rows into tabs hides where a
 * profile's overrides are.
 *
 * ⚠️ It was a dot — a boolean — until 6.0.0, and a dot answers the wrong question. Inside a
 * dialog the user is deciding what to keep and what to give back, and "this tab has something"
 * leaves them opening five tabs to find two rows. The number costs the same badge.
 *
 * ⚠️ Counts are NOT fields of `tabs`, on purpose. A binding that rebuilt the tab list whenever a
 * value changed would make the Repeater recreate every TabButton, and a TabBar that loses its
 * items resets its current index — the section would jump back to the first tab mid-edit.
 *
 * `shoulders` draws the LB / RB prompts at the two ends of the strip (PgUp / PgDn once the
 * keyboard is in use — ActionHint decides). Settings leaves them off: there the status bar
 * already carries them. Clicking a prompt cycles like the button would.
 *
 * ⚠️ The ring WRAPS — see cycle(). And the strip never takes focus: sections are switched with
 * LB/RB or the mouse, never by walking onto the tabs with the D-pad.
