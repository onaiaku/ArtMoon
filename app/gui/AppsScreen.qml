 * host, here it is the game — so moving between the two screens does not mean learning a
 * second way of reading.
 *
 * What the grid of covers could never show, because there was nowhere to put it: which
 * store a game comes from in words rather than a 16px badge, whether it is running right
 * now, whether it carries settings of its own, and the right verb on the button — Resume
 * for a session already up, Play for one that isn't.
 *
 * Root is FocusScope (not Item) — required for activeFocus propagation from the Loader
 * above us down into the two zones. Plain Items do not propagate.
