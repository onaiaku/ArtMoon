     * A wake is the better part of a minute of nothing visible happening, and "which part is
     * slow" used to be answerable only by noticing which row had the spinner — never by how
     * long it had been there. So the rows that are actually waited on — the host appearing and
     * StreamTweak coming up — carry their own elapsed time while they run and keep the figure
     * once they are settled.
     *
     * The first row has no clock: the packet leaves in a fraction of a second, so its figure
     * was a number next to a tick that said nothing the tick did not. HomeScreen still times
     * it — only the display is gone.
     *
     * Three parallel arrays rather than three objects, because the Repeater below already
     * walks these by the same index it uses for the labels.
