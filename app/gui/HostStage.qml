/*
 * The stage — one host, filling the screen.
 *
 * This file draws and nothing else. Every value it shows arrives as a property and every
 * button it offers leaves as `activated(kind)`; it owns no timers, no model, no dialogs and
 * never talks to ComputerModel. HomeScreen keeps all of that. The split exists because the
 * old host tile had 593 lines of visuals wound through the machinery that fed them, which
 * made both halves hard to change — and because the stage is now the whole screen, so it
 * would have grown, not shrunk.
 *
 * The one piece of state that does live here is which action has the focus, because the
 * action row is drawn here: HomeScreen says *whether* this zone has the focus, the stage
 * says *where inside it*.

     * ── The backdrop, baked into one ramp when there is no picture ───────────────────────
     *
     * ⚠️ Two stacked ramps used to draw this: the host's colour pair, and a scrim over it for
     * the text. Both horizontal, both dithered — and the card banded anyway. The measurement
     * says why, and it is not the dither: across the LEFT 60% of the card the base ramp offers
     * 48 distinct values and the composite offers EIGHT. The scrim's alpha throws away forty
     * of them, so what looks like a gradient there is really a flat field with six or eight
     * accidental steps in it, each a couple of hundred pixels wide. No dithering can invent
     * levels the 8-bit output of a blend has already discarded — an ordered tile can only
     * feather eight pixels of each step, and 1-D error diffusion was tried and measured
     * (48 px of flat run down to 27) and still did not show.
     *
     * So the two ramps become one, which is possible because both run along x: their composite
     * is a function of x alone and can be written as a single set of stops. And the part that
     * was nearly flat is made EXACTLY flat, because a region spanning six levels over fourteen
     * hundred pixels is not a gradient — it is a flat colour that occasionally jumps, and the
     * jumps are the artefact. One quantisation, one dither, and two fewer effect passes.
     *
     * The stops below follow the old composite's own values, so the card looks like it did
     * apart from the banding: flat at what the blend produced around 30% across, then falling
     * away through the values it produced at 72% and beyond.
     *
     * ⚠️ Only when there is no picture. Over a picture the scrim is veiling an image and has to
     * stay a separate layer — that case is a different problem, and the colour bias inside the
     * provider is what addresses it.

    /*
     * The game you last streamed on this host — name, artwork, hours, sessions.
     *
     * ⚠️ Nothing here comes from the host. Until 5.6.1 this panel showed the host's last
     * *session*, fetched over the bridge, which meant it described whatever had streamed
     * — possibly from another client — and vanished entirely without StreamTweak. It now
     * describes what YOU played, from a record kept on this machine, and works against a
     * plain Sunshine host.
     *
     * ⚠️ The layout is GameFacts, the same component the host page's spotlight uses. It
     * was laid out by hand here first — text beside the cover, no shadow, four figures —
     * against the spotlight's cover-above-centred-shadowed-two-figures, and one idea
     * wearing two faces is what that was. Do not re-implement it here.
     *
     * An empty map means draw nothing at all: never streamed here, record reset, or the
     * game is gone from the host's app list. There is no empty state — the card simply
     * goes back to what it looks like without one.
     *
     * ⚠️ 6.0.0: while the host is streaming, the same block shows THAT instead — see
     * runningApp. Every field below picks between the two, and only those fields: the
     * geometry is one, so the running session is sized, scaled and aligned by exactly the
     * rules that were already tuned for Last played.
     *
     * ⚠️ 6.0.0: a child of the STAGE now, not of the card — the card became the left part of
     * the stage (see _cardW) and this block stands on the floor beside it. Every number below
     * is the one it had inside the full-width card, and `parent` still means an item whose
     * right and top edges are where that card's were, so the block sits exactly where it did.
