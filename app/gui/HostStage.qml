 * The stage — one host, filling the screen.
 *
 * This file draws and nothing else. Every value it shows arrives as a property and every
 * button it offers leaves as `activated(kind)`; it owns no timers, no model, no dialogs and
 * never talks to ComputerModel. HomeScreen keeps all of that. The split exists because the
 * old host tile had 593 lines of visuals wound through the machinery that fed them, which
 * made both halves hard to change — and because the stage is now the whole screen, so it
 * would have grown, not shrunk.
 *
 * The one piece of state that does live here is which action has the focus, because the
 * action row is drawn here: HomeScreen says *whether* this zone has the focus, the stage
 * says *where inside it*.

     *
     * ⚠️ Two stacked ramps used to draw this: the host's colour pair, and a scrim over it for
     * the text. Both horizontal, both dithered — and the card banded anyway. The measurement
     * says why, and it is not the dither: across the LEFT 60% of the card the base ramp offers
     * 48 distinct values and the composite offers EIGHT. The scrim's alpha throws away forty
     * of them, so what looks like a gradient there is really a flat field with six or eight
     * accidental steps in it, each a couple of hundred pixels wide. No dithering can invent
     * levels the 8-bit output of a blend has already discarded — an ordered tile can only
     * feather eight pixels of each step, and 1-D error diffusion was tried and measured
     * (48 px of flat run down to 27) and still did not show.
     *
     * So the two ramps become one, which is possible because both run along x: their composite
     * is a function of x alone and can be written as a single set of stops. And the part that
     * was nearly flat is made EXACTLY flat, because a region spanning six levels over fourteen
     * hundred pixels is not a gradient — it is a flat colour that occasionally jumps, and the
     * jumps are the artefact. One quantisation, one dither, and two fewer effect passes.
     *
     * The stops below follow the old composite's own values, so the card looks like it did
     * apart from the banding: flat at what the blend produced around 30% across, then falling
     * away through the values it produced at 72% and beyond.
     *
     * ⚠️ Only when there is no picture. Over a picture the scrim is veiling an image and has to
     * stay a separate layer — that case is a different problem, and the colour bias inside the
     * provider is what addresses it.

         * 5.1.0 first put all three in one layer, masked once — tidier, one pass fewer, and
         * it broke this: the picture stopped appearing and the card showed the ramp under the
         * scrim, reported as "the dark bordeaux gradient". The measurements say the file, the
         * path and the mask are all fine — the same picture renders correctly in an isolated
         * scene — but inside the layer the element never left `status: Loading`, with its
         * painted geometry already computed, so it never produced a node to be rendered into
         * the FBO. The small provider-generated ramps beside it were unaffected, which is why
         * the card looked half-right.
         *
         * An effect sampling this Image directly does not depend on any of that: it asks the
         * texture provider every frame and draws whatever is there. It is the arrangement
         * 5.0.0 shipped and the one that demonstrably works. The cost is one extra pass on a
         * card that is redrawn only when something about the host changes.

         * when deciding whether to stream again.
         *
         * No frame and no fill: it is part of the card, not a box resting on it. A bordered
         * panel made the same information read as a second, foreign surface — which is exactly
         * how it looked, because the design it came from is StreamTweak's, not this one's.
         * Sitting directly on the backdrop it becomes the right-hand half of one card.
         *
         * It follows the card's own grid — top aligned with the chip row, right margin the
         * same as the field row — and the card's own reading tones (_onBg / _onBg2 / _onBg3),
         * so it flips with a light backdrop like everything else instead of staying
         * near-white and vanishing.
         *
         * ⚠️ The scrim is at its thinnest on this side, deliberately, so a host picture gets
         * to be a picture. With no fill of its own the panel now leans on that: if a bright
         * photo ever makes it hard to read, the fix is the scrim's right-hand stop, not a box
         * around this.
