 * ── One game, presented (5.7.0) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Cover, title, one meta line, and the two figures that matter: hours and sessions.
 *
 * ⚠️ It exists because BOTH screens show this and they had drifted. Home laid the text out
 * beside the cover with no shadow and four figures; the host page put it underneath, centred
 * and shadowed, with two. One idea wearing two faces — the eye has to re-learn the screen
 * every time it moves between them, and every future change has to be made twice, which is
 * how they diverged in the first place. One component, two callers, and they cannot disagree
 * again.
 *
 * The picture is HeroCover, so the shadow here and the shadow in the spotlight are not
 * "matched": they are the same code.
 *
 * The caller composes `meta` and gives `availableHeight`; this works out the cover from what
 * is left. See coverHeight.
