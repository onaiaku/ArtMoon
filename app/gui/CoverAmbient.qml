 * The blurred box art behind a screen, under the veil that keeps text readable on it.
 *
 * Extracted from AppsScreen so that the host page, the launch screen and the quit screen
 * stand on the same artwork instead of on three drawings that merely resemble each other.
 * The launch screen used to build a gradient out of two colours sampled from the cover,
 * which is a different picture of the same game: crossing from one screen to the next the
 * background changed under you at the exact moment nothing else should move.
 *
 * ⚠️ Draws nothing at all when there is no artwork, or when the user has asked for reduced
 * animations. That is not a fallback bolted on: it is how the caller gets the app's standard
 * gradient back, because whatever sits behind this item shows through untouched.
