// mouse.

// Call sites say what the action IS — the pad button and its keyboard equivalent — never
// which of the two to draw. That decision belongs here and nowhere else, which is the same
// reason PadGlyph resolves the vendor by itself: a prompt that each screen decides for
// itself is a prompt that will eventually disagree with the one next to it.
