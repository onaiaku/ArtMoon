/**
 * XboxTileArtwork — branded tile artwork for the Windows 11 Xbox app
 * "Le mie app" view.
 *
 * The Xbox app (Microsoft.GamingApp) stores user-added Win32 apps in:
 *
 *   %LocalAppData%\Packages\Microsoft.GamingApp_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\
 *     CustomLibraryManagement\CustomLibraryManagement.manifest
 *
 * For curated launchers (Steam, Epic, GOG, ...) Microsoft ships pre-bundled
 * tile artwork. For everything else, the Xbox app extracts a PNG from the
 * .exe's embedded icon — which gives ArtMoon an ugly grey square because
 * the .ico's swoosh sits on transparency.
 *
 * This class provides three layers of self-healing for the tile artwork,
 * all based on overwriting the imagePath PNG with the embedded gradient
 * artwork from qrc:/artmoonxbox.png:
 *
 *   1. applyIfRegistered()  — boot patch (ArtMoon startup).
 *                              If an entry already exists, sync its PNG.
 *
 *   2. registerEntry()      — proactive pre-population. Writes a manifest
 *                              entry pointing to our PNG so the user sees
 *                              ArtMoon in "Le mie app" with the proper
 *                              tile WITHOUT ever clicking "+". Invoked by
 *                              the Inno Setup installer via the
 *                              --register-xbox-tile CLI flag when the user
 *                              opts in during install.
 *
 *   3. startWatching()      — runtime FileSystemWatcher. While ArtMoon
 *                              is running, react to manifest changes (eg.
 *                              user clicks "+" anyway, or Xbox app rewrites
 *                              the PNG) and re-patch within ~250 ms.
 *
 * All methods are Windows-only no-ops on other platforms.
 * All operations are idempotent and atomic (QSaveFile).
