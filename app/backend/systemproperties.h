     * True when this machine is configured for the Xbox full screen experience — a handheld
     * device form, or a gaming home app set. Windows-only; false everywhere else.
     *
     * It gates rebuilding the native window on the way out of a stream (main.qml), which is
     * the only known cure for the grey screen that shell leaves behind and a pointless step
     * anywhere else.
     *
     * ⚠️ It says DEVICE, not SESSION, and that is not a shortcut — it is what the data
     * allows. Measured on 01/09/2026, an Ally in the Xbox experience and an ordinary desktop
     * are indistinguishable from inside the process: explorer.exe is the shell in both,
     * GetShellWindow, the taskbar, Progman and Winlogon all read the same. The only thing
     * that moved with the shell was Progman's visibility, and only when the device had
     * BOOTED into the experience — not when it was entered from the desktop, which is the
     * case where the grey screen was actually observed. So a session detector would have
     * skipped the fix exactly where it is needed.
     *
     * The consequence, stated rather than hidden: on a handheld the rebuild runs even in
     * desktop mode. That errs towards the working behaviour and away from the hitch, which
     * is the right way round for a defect that reads as a broken app.
