/**
 * StreamTweakBridge
 *
 * Sends one-shot TCP commands to StreamTweak on the host PC (port 47998).
 *
 * Commands:
 *   NETINFO / SETSPEED — host link-speed matching (StreamTweak 8.1.0+); see below.
 *              They replace PREPARE, which applied a target the host itself configured.
 *   SHUTDOWN — asks the host to power off. Destructive; StreamTweak only honours
 *              it from an approved client (verified AUTH1 signature). Fire-and-forget.
 *   SHUTDOWN_UPDATE — like SHUTDOWN, but the host installs any pending Windows
 *              updates before powering off ("Update and shut down"). Same approval
 *              requirement as SHUTDOWN. Fire-and-forget.
 *   UPDATESTATE — asks whether the host has updates waiting for a reboot.
 *              StreamTweak replies with {"pending":true|false}.
 *   STATUS   — queries the current NIC speed from StreamTweak.
 *              StreamTweak replies with the link speed in Mbps (e.g. "1000").
 *   STATS    — requests real-time host metrics (GPU %, encoder %, temperature,
 *              VRAM used, CPU %, network TX). StreamTweak replies with a JSON
 *              object, e.g. {"gpu":45,"gpu_enc":80,"gpu_temp":72,"vram_used":4200,
 *              "cpu":30,"net_tx":18}, or "STATS_UNAVAILABLE".
 *
 * The query commands (STATUS, STATS, NETINFO, APPSTORES, TAILSCALE, UPDATESTATE)
 * take a per-call completion callback that receives the trimmed response line, or an
 * empty string on error/timeout.
 *
 * Each query owns its own socket and its own callback, so concurrent requests
 * never cross-talk. Responses are buffered until the protocol's '\n' terminator
 * arrives (or the peer closes), so replies split across multiple TCP segments
 * (large APPSTORES payloads) are no longer truncated. A per-request watchdog
 * guarantees the callback fires exactly once even if the host connects but never
 * sends a newline-terminated reply.
