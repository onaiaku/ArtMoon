/**
 * One colour generates the whole interface.
 *
 * <p>Every accent-bearing surface in the app — the focus ring, the primary button, the active
 * tab, the mark in the header, the wash on the background — reads from here rather than naming
 * a colour of its own. That is what makes the accent user-settable at all: 377 literals spread
 * across 22 QML files could never have been recoloured from a settings page.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The rule that keeps this usable: semantic colours never follow the accent.</b> Online
 * stays green, a pending link change stays amber, Shut down stays red, offline stays grey. If
 * they tracked the accent, a user who picked red would read "online" in red and the colour would
 * stop meaning anything. The accent says <i>where you are</i>; the semantics say <i>how it is</i>.
 * They are exposed here together so that the distinction is visible in one file instead of being
 * a convention people have to remember.</p>

     * The type scale. Seven steps, and nothing outside them.
     *
     * <p>A modular scale: base 16 with a minor third (1.2), so every size is a fixed ratio of
     * every other rather than a number somebody liked at the time. The steps come out at
     * 11 · 13 · 16 · 19 · 23 · 28 · 34, which is not a coincidence — those seven were already
     * the most-used sizes in the app. What the scale removes is the <i>other</i> fourteen that
     * had accumulated beside them: 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 26 and 30 each existed in one
     * or two files, a pixel or two from a neighbour, for no reason anybody could state.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>Why it belongs here rather than in a QML singleton.</b> Same argument as the
     * colours: these are read from 47 files, and the day the base or the ratio moves it has to
     * move once. Written as literals they could not be moved at all — which is exactly the
     * state they were in.</p>
     *
     * <p>⚠️ Design sizes, NOT final pixels. Every caller still multiplies by the interface
     * scale — <tt>_px(Theme.fontBody)</tt>, not <tt>Theme.fontBody</tt> — except the window
     * chrome, which is sized in fixed pixels on purpose. Handing out pre-scaled values here
     * would take that choice away from the call site.</p>
     *
     * <p>The four sizes above the scale (40, 52, 64, 68, 100) are deliberately not steps: they
     * are one-off display figures — the PIN digits, the segue title, the big numbers on the
     * stage — each used exactly once, where the size <i>is</i> the design rather than a
     * position in a hierarchy.</p>

     *
     * It lives on the theme because of who could not reach it. A dialog is not inside a page —
     * it sits in the overlay above all of them — so it had no way to read a page's scale, and
     * every dialog in the app was therefore written in fixed pixels. On a large screen that
     * left the popups drawn at roughly half the size of the page behind them: a button written
     * as 44 on the host page comes out at 70, while the same button written as 38 in a dialog
     * comes out at 38, on any screen. Fixed numbers cannot be corrected by picking bigger ones,

     * ⚠️ Deliberately a property and not a `px(n)` invokable. A C++ invokable is opaque to the

     * would keep whatever value it happened to be built with. Callers multiply by it, or wrap
     * it in a QML-side helper — where the engine does see the property read.
