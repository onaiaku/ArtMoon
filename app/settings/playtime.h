// Per-game play time, kept by the client (StreamLight 5.7.0).
//
// How long you have streamed each game, and how the last session on it went. Everything
// here is measured on this side and stored on this machine: no bridge verb, no StreamTweak,
// nothing fetched. It is what the host card's "Last played" block and the host page's
// "Continue" row are drawn from, and what the per-game panel reports and can reset.
//
// ── The key ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Records are keyed by host uuid + the *name* of the game, not by app id.
//
// ⚠️ The name is what survives a reinstall, which is the whole requirement. App ids do not:
// for the games StreamTweak manages, the id is derived from the lowercased name
// (SunshineSync.StableAppId), so it moves when the name is corrected; for entries added by
// hand in the streaming server's own UI, the server assigns it however it likes, and Apollo
// or Vibepollo may not agree with Sunshine.
//
// ⚠️ The uuid, and NOT NvComputer::storageKey(). That is how per-game overrides, host
// profiles and the box art cache are already keyed — so a Tailscale clone and the LAN tile
// it was cloned from share one set of hours, which is right: it is the same PC reached by
// another road. Keying on the storage key would split them in two and restart the count the
// first time you streamed over Tailscale.
//
// ⚠️ The name cannot BE the settings key. On Windows these live in the registry, where
// QSettings treats '/' as a group separator and rejects '\' outright — so a title like
// "Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales" is not a legal key name. The group is a hex digest of
// the normalised name, and the readable name is stored as a value inside it.
