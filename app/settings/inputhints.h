/**
 * Which input device the user is actually holding, so every on-screen prompt can name a
 * button they can press.
 *
 * Before this, every prompt drew a controller glyph unconditionally: starting ArtMoon
 * with a keyboard and never touching a pad still showed "B Back" with an Xbox glyph. The
 * rule here is the one games use — the last device that produced real input wins, and the
 * whole interface follows it at once.
 *
 * ⚠️ The trap this class exists to avoid: SdlGamepadKeyNavigation *synthesises Qt key
 * events* for pad buttons (B becomes Key_Escape, the D-pad becomes arrows). A naive
 * keyboard filter counts those as typing and flips straight back on every pad press. Real
 * key events from the window system are spontaneous; posted ones are not, and that is the
 * only reliable difference — see the filter in the .cpp.

     * a key press or a mouse CLICK and pointedly ignores mouse movement, because a mouse
     * knocked on a desk must not repaint every prompt in the interface. A hidden pointer
     * cannot afford that rule: if only a click brought it back, the way to find an invisible
